The purpose of my project is to become familiar with classes, methods, attributes, and to understand object oriented programming. In my car class, I included all of the necessary attributes. I used the 'self' + '.' + 'attribute name' method to initialize them. I also added limitations such as changing the interior/exterior colors, changing the attributes, increasing mileage, etc. I constructed my methods in the class declaration and I used default values for parameters. The way I implemented my program was by understanding how all of the attributes, methods, and limitations work together to create a class.
